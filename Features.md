# Features

## Classes
* Sneak Attack (Rogue level 1) is a toggable passive which works on any weapon attack you hit in the turn (including offhand attacks)
* Cunning Action (Rogue level 2) gives Hide and Disengage (besides Dash) as bonus actions as well
* Colossus Slayer (Ranger level 3) correctly deals bonus damage on offhand attacks
* Arcane Ward subsequent casts after the first of the day provides the correct `2*Spell Level` Temporary HP
* Wild Shape dismissal costs a bonus action
* Wild Shape Polar Bear is replaced with Brown Bear, visual and stat wise
* Wild Shape Giant Badger changes to attacks and movements

## Actions
* Hide and Shove are actions (from bonus actions)
* Introduces Disengage, Dodge and Shove (to Prone) as actions to player characters (single spell container)
* Jump only costs Movement, but can't be used while Threatened (Flanked), unless the character Disengages first
* Shove's push range is reduced to 1.5 m (from 4 m)

## Spells
* Hold Person correctly allows a Saving Throw on Turn End instead of Turn Start
* Hex and Hunter's Query correctly deals bonus damage on offhand attacks
* Produce Flame scales with Wisdom for Druids
* Goodberry provides 10 berries, each healing 1 HP (and full stomach, if using DnDon't Starve)

## Hit Dice
* Short resting puts the characters in a standby mode and provides them with 2 new spells
  - Regain Hit Points: spend 1 Hit Die to recover its value plus the character's Constitution Modifier
  - End Short Rest: Ends the short rest standby mode
* Long resting recharges half the character's level worth of Hit Dice (rounded up)

## Global changes
* Removes weapon abilities (like Cleave, Smash and Pin Down)
* Removes Backstabbing from the game
* Removes the auto-failing Strength and Dexterity Saving Throws when Prone
* Nerfs Fire dipped and Poison coating damage to 1 static damage (from 1d4)
* Removes surface creation on most benefitial potions (like healing and resistance potions) - you can't heal people by throwing potions at their feet!

## Feats
* Fixes the AC bonus from Dual Wielder

## Two-Weapon Fighting
* Removes the automatic offhand bonus attack option when Dual Wielding (This fixes Dual Wielding AoO as well)
* The Offhand Attack is only available after attacking with the main hand weapon while Dual Wielding (or when outside of Combat)
* There's a partial fix to Offhand's attack and damage roll:
  * The attack roll uses the main hand weapon, so the ability is Dexterity for finesse (if higher than Strength) or Strength for the rest
  * _If the main hand weapon is magic, the bonus on attack roll will pass to the offhand attack as well_
